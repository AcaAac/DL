## Homework 1: MLP

### Description

This assignment focuses on implementing and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for a classification task. The homework folder contains the problem sheet, the submitted code, and the detailed report.

### Installation

To set up the environment for Homework 1, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AcaAac/Deep-Learning--IST.git

# Navigate to the MLP homework directory
cd Deep-Learning--IST/Homework_1

# Unzip the submitted code
unzip 96138_105545.zip

# Download and install the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset
# You can download it from: https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist

# Install PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision


```

### Usage

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the code

cd Deep-Learning--IST/Homework_1/96138_105545
